"Commonwealth of Australia","All",5e+07,"Car Rental Services - Whole of Australian GovernmentIn the interests of transparency, the Department of Finance&nbsp;and Deregulation (Finance)&nbsp;has estimated the total spend against this Standing Offer over the life of the agreements with the two panel suppliers to be in the order of $50 million (GST inclusive). In the documentation associated with the original approach to market, Request for Tender FIN11/FMG020, which closed on 30 January 2012, the total estimated annual spend by agencies subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 against the major car rental companies operating in Australia was $23 million in financial year 2010-11. However, it was acknowledged at the time that the data available to arrive at that estimate may not have been accurate. Finance's expectation is that future data on expenditure for car rental services&nbsp;against the two panel suppliers will be greater than is currently available and more accurate; therefore, the estimate will be reviewed and updated where necessary during the period of the Standing Offer. Expenditure on individual car rentals is anticipated to be well below the threshold for separate reporting on AusTender.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Open tender","Vehicle rental","Vehicle rental",1,5e+07,0,5e+07,0,"All"
